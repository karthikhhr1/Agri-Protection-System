**“Create a production-ready mobile and web app called AgriShield AI designed specifically for farmers, agriculture field officers, and cooperatives. The app must detect plant pests and diseases with extreme accuracy using state-of-the-art vision models. This is a real-world farming tool — it must be fast, reliable, and idiot-proof.

CORE PURPOSE

Farmers take a photo of a crop → the app instantly identifies the pest/disease → explains severity → gives clear treatment steps → generates a field report.

NON-NEGOTIABLE REQUIREMENTS (Very High Accuracy & Reliability)

Ultra-accurate detection of pests, fungal diseases, nutrient deficiencies, leaf spots, stem issues, root patterns.

Confidence score per detection.

Works with dirty, low-light, real farm images — not studio photos.

Offline mode for image capture and queuing (critical for rural areas).

Model must be optimized for real crops in India: rice, wheat, maize, sugarcane, cotton, pulses, vegetables, fruits.

Must support 20+ common pests (e.g., fall armyworm, aphids, whiteflies, bollworm) and major diseases (blight, mildew, rust, mosaic, rot).

USER EXPERIENCE (Simple Enough for Any Farmer)
